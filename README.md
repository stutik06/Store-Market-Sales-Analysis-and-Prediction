# Store-Market-Sales-Analysis-and-Prediction
 **Store Market Sales Prediction â€“ Detailed Description**
- **Objective:** This project aims to predict sales performance across multiple stores by analyzing product and outlet features using machine learning models.  
- **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Applied **label encoding** to convert categorical variables (e.g., `Item_Type`, `Outlet_Size`, `Outlet_Location_Type`) into numerical values, making the data suitable for ML models.  
   - Normalized numerical features like `Item_Visibility` and `Item_MRP` to ensure consistent scaling.  
- **Data Visualization Insights:**  
   - **Outlet Establishment Year:** The majority of outlets were founded in **1985**, making them the most common and potentially high-performing stores.  
   - **Product Categories:** **Fruits and Vegetables** and **Snack Foods** have the highest sales, indicating their high demand.  
   - **Outlet Size Distribution:** Medium-sized outlets dominate, suggesting they contribute significantly to overall sales.  
- **Model Application:**  
   - The project helps in forecasting sales trends, optimizing product placement, and enhancing marketing strategies.  
   - Retailers can make data-driven decisions to maximize revenue by identifying high-performing products and stores.
